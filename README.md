- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @saiful-jumari
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in - physics, mathematics, localisation algorithms in robotics, finding simple solutions for complex problems
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning - localisation algorithms in robotics, linear algebra, lie groups applied to robotics, multi-view geometry
- âš¡ Fun fact: I was a physics student in uni and was deeply interested in theoretical physics. If a math problem is stuck in my head I won't hesitate to take out pencil and paper and write out the equations.
- I'm a software engineer but I simply view code as a means to bring about some postive change in the world
